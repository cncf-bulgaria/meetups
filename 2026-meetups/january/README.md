# 👋 Wellcome!

Moving past the "Hello World" of GitOps is where the real fun (and the real chaos) begins. This repository contains the slides from my January talk, focusing on building a robust, automated, and secure Day 2 ecosystem.

## 📂 View the presentation slides [Here](./gitops-on-day-2.pdf)

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

We explored how to move from manual intervention to a self-healing, self-updating infrastructure. Highlights include:

* **The Day 2 Mindset:** Shifting focus from "getting it running" to "keeping it healthy."
* **Renovate:** Why manual dependency updates are a thing of the past.
* **Harbor:** Securing your supply chain before the first pod even starts.
* **n8n + ArgoCD:** Leveraging low-code automation for sophisticated PR reviews and seamless deployments.
